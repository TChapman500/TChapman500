Whoever does not allow someone to speek freely is a criminal and an enemy of the people, and is in violation of a fundamental human right (the right to free speech)!

- For general information, see the [About Me](https://tchapman500.com/about-me) page on my website.
- My general interests are in game development, sim racing, flight simulation, digital logic circuits, and pretty much anything that has to do with engineering.
- My current programming-related projects (all in game-development) are [Solar Lander](https://store.steampowered.com/app/724170/Solar_Lander/), and my own racing simulator.
- I'm also working on a 16-bit processor using [Logisim Evolution (Holy Cross Edition)](https://github.com/kevinawalsh/logisim-evolution).
